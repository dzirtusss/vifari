# Vifari

Vimium/Vimari for Safari without browser extension in pure Lua.

![Screnshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9054bba8-d59f-445b-a973-e4b56d15e79a)

- Not a browser extension - works via accessability API, so most probably will work with
any Safari version despite past or future Plugin API changes. Theoretically, it
is even easily adjustable for other browsers. Works in all Safari parts - e.g. doesn't
stall on empty pages, works on Start Page (for bookmarks), etc.

- No Swift/XCode - only Lua. Just a single text file.

- No need for Apple Developer account, etc. No distribution via App Store needed.

- Fully trustable from security perspective, because it is FOSS with Lua readable by any programmer.
No keylogging risk and ok to run on sensitive sites with credentials/tokens/etc.

- A bonus - people who are interested in Vi bindings, most probably already know Lua to some extent.

This is a very early version, code is a bit messy, some minor bugs expected, but it is fully functional
on the level of Vimari at least. Plans are to keep it reasonably simple, so it will never be as
advanced as Vimium, but it should cover most of the daily needs for a Safari user (like me).
PRs and ideas are welcomed.

Initially, this was an attempt to make Vimari a bit better (e.g. by adding `yy` or `g1`).
But it became so hard with Swift (and Apple plugin distribution), and so easy with Hammerspoon and
Lua, that just for fun I tried to do `f` with marks in Hammerspoon/Lua (which is the core functionality)
and it worked so well, that I removed Vimari the next day.

There are some other Safari extensions that do vimming except Vimari, but despite being
more polished, they are closed source and thus raise security worries. To a point that
I can't use those on sites with any potential credentials (e.g. AWS, Heroku, etc.).
Which minimizes their usefulness and only creates anger of switching back&forth and using mouse.

## Installation

### brew

`brew install dzirtusss/tap/vifari`

NOTE: This is a cask, not a formula, because it depends on `hammerspoon` which is
as well a cask, and needs to be installed to `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/Vifari.spoon/...` folder.

Update with `brew cu vifari` (to latest release)

PS: I've just added brew formula, so please open issue if you have any problems.

### Manual

1. Install [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) e.g. as `brew install hammerspoon`

2. Get this repo, either of:

  - clone this repo to `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/Vifari.spoon`

  - clone to any other location like your projects folder and
    add symlink to `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/Vifari.spoon`

  - just copy `init.lua` to `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/Vifari.spoon/init.lua`

Update with `git pull` to latest main branch.

## Configuration

Add to your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:
```lua
hs.loadSpoon("Vifari")
spoon.Vifari:start() -- this will add hooks. `:stop()` to remove hooks

-- or if you want to customize it
spoon.Vifari:start({
    -- example your local config here
    scrollStep = 150,  -- Change scroll step
    mapping = {
        ["j"] = "cmdScrollDownFast",  -- Change existing mapping
        ["n"] = { "cmd", "n" },       -- Add new mapping
        ["x"] = false,                -- Disable a mapping
    }
})
```

4. After restarting Hammerspoon, you should see `V` in the menu bar when Safari is focused.
   hjkl (and other keys) should work.

5. Refresh local repo sometimes to get the latest version.

6. Consider configuring your app launcher if needed (Spotlight and Raycast are preconfigured).

7. Enjoy!


## Usage

Vifari automatically detects "text input" fields, so when you *natutally* type something, most probably
it will not interfere. When you *naturally* are not in the text field, it will use Vi Normal mode binds.
This works rather smoothly, but may be not perfect for all cases.

If you need to disable Normal mode, press `i` - it will be in Insert mode till next `escape`.

If hjkl not working on some sitte, most probably it has a hidden text field to capture keystrokes (which
is recognized by Vifari as a valid text field). Hit `escape` to unfocus normally. Or even if this doesn't
help - `escape+escape` to force unfocus from any place.

If hjkl doens't work but `f/F/t` show marks, most probably your mouse cursor is out of the scrollable area.
Use `gf` to navigate to some visible element and then use `hjkl`.

If you want to totally disable Vifari do `spoons.Vifari:stop()` in hammerspoon console.

### Current binds:

View top of `init.lua` for full list of binds. Fully customizable.

```
# mode switching
i - enter insert mode till next escape
escape - exit insert mode or abort any other multi-key combination
escape+escape (quickly) - forced unfocus from any control and any place

# movements
h/j/k/l - scroll left/down/up/right
u/d - scroll half page up/down
gg/G - scroll to top/bottom

# links/jumps
f - show marks and jump in same window
F - show marks and jump in new window
gf - show marks and move mouse to the mark
gi - focus the first text input

# tabs
q/w - prev/next tab
r - reload page
x - close tab
t - new tab
o - open
[] - back and forward in history
del (backspace) - back in history
g1-8 - go to tab 1-8
g9, g$ - go to last tab

# mouse
zz - move mouse to center

# clipboard
yy - copy current page URL to clipboard
yf - copy picked URL to clipboard
```

All keys with modifiers (except shift) are passed through to Safari, thus most of the
native Safari key bindings will continue to work as expected.

### Menu bar

There is a menu bar with mode indicator:
```
V - Vifari mode
X - unfocused
g/f/F/t/y/... - or other symbols show multi-key combination start
```

### Tips

- If `hjkl` don't work, most probably mouse cursor is out of the scrollable area. Use `gf` to navigate to some
  visible element and then use `hjkl`.

- `gf` is very handy to switch scrollable areas on very complex pages ot to move cursot to scrollable area.

- Some sites are using invisible non-hidden text fields (to capture custom keystrokes?), which Vifari recognizes
  as valid text fields and auto-disables Normal mode. In such a case it helps to press `escape` so that this
  hidden field will loose focus, and continue in Normal mode. In very hard cases, use `escape+escape` to force
  unfocus from any place.

- If something unsolvable happens - hit reload config in Hammerspoon.

- Bookmarks, reading list, iCloud tabs, etc. are accessible via Start Page where `f` works (not `F`).

## Known issues

- Rarely it is a bit laggy (e.g. key pressed, but command is executed a bit later), but that's mostly
happens in times of Safari's unresponsiveness - e.g. processing a heavy page just at the moment.

## Possible next todo ideas

- Analog of `f` command but for toolbar, tabbar, etc.
- Bitwarden/1Password support by keypress
